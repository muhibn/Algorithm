1. Consider the binary search algorithm done in the class. If the statements {return BSearch(arr, mid + 1, high, key)} and {return BSearch(arr, low, mid-1, key)} are replaced by {return BSearch(arr, mid , high, key)} and {return BSearch(arr, low, mid, key)} respectively, What effect will it have on the function?
2. Given a sorted array A[1,..., n] such that elements may not be distinct. The array is rotated around some random position. Modify binary search such that for a given 'key', it returns the index where 'key' is present (if it exists) in (log n) time.
3. Given a sorted array A[1,..., n] such that elements are all distinct. Give an O(lg(n) time algorithm that finds out if there exists a 'k' such that A[k] = k. The algorithm returns 'k' if such an index exists, else -1.
